                                 <p>Weâ€™ve spent over 60 years curating our global network of premium growers and distributors in order to offer our customers unrivaled quality and selection. Our products range from essential and rare spice varietals to proprietary rubs and blends.</p>

                                <h4>Delivery Schedule</h4>
                                 <p>The United States Postal Service (USPS) is struggling with increased package volume and decreased revenue, each of which is related to COVID-19. Most of our free shipping is delivered by the USPS. This includes free shipping on orders over $49 and flatpack free shipping. These economy shipping services are the most prone to delay. To minimize the chance of delivery delays, we encourage customers to select UPS Ground.</p>
